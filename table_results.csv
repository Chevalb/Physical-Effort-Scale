;;I-CVI;CVR;Clarity;Recommendations for improvements
Item;items;I-CVI is computed as the number of experts giving a rating of “very relevant” for each item divided by the total number of experts. Value from 0 to 1.;CVR_=_(Ne – N/2)/(N/2), where Ne is the number of panelists indicating an item as “essential” and N is the total number of panelists. CVR varies between -1 and +1.;Averaged value;

item1_app;1.     Thinking about activities that require physical effort energizes me. ;0,444444444;-0,333333333;2,555555556;"I gave a 2 rating to every item that uses ""physical effort"" because in our laboratory's own testing of these words, the interpretation varied widely between individuals. I suggest the authors consider a few other terms in addition to ""physical effort"". In our own program, this was usually interpretted as activities of a strenuous nature and wasn't inclusive of lighter and more moderate activities."

This item is similar to items in the CRAVE scale (Stults-Kolehmainen, Blacutt et al., 2021) which specifies desires, wants, urges and cravings ""in the moment"" or ""right now"" or, for another version ""in the past week"". In this case, I believe you want to make the case about ""tendency"" so I believe the item might need a small modification or the instructions need to make that clear. The same apply for the other items. Also, from this point on (down to item 18), I gave ""2"" for essentiality only because an item seems redundant with an item above it."
